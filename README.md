# burger

This app ia a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). 

Following MVC (model, view, controller) design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

How app works!

	*Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

	*Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
	
	*Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
	
	*The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
